To access the world in simulation, there are two different approaches:

## Opttion-1

Download the following file and copy paste it content in _**models_config.json**_ file present in  _**~/cognipilot/cranium/AIM_2024_launcher**_ directory. After that run the launcher script by executing following commands:

 ```
$ cd ~/cognipilot/cranium/AIM_2024_launcher
$ python launch_sim.py start
```
