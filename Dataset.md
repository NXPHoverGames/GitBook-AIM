# Dataset for Traffic Sign Recognition

In NXP AIM 2024, we will be working on following traffic signs:
1. Go Straight Traffic Sign
2. Turn Left Traffic Sign
3. Turn Right Traffic Sign
4. Stop Traffic sign

{% hint style="danger" %}
Teams have to divide the dataset into train/validation/test sub-sets on their own.
{% endhint %}

## Traffic Sign Designs

{% hint style="info" %}
Teams can add more images to the data set as per their needs by refering to images of finalised traffic sign design in below file 
{% endhint %}

{% file src=".gitbook/assets/AIM_2024/Signs_design.docx" %}
Traffic Sign Designs and sizes
{% endfile %}

## Unlabbled data set

The below file conatins all the images that can be used in training of ypur model are present here.

Unlabbled data set
{% endfile %}

## Labbled/bounded data set

The below file conatins all the images along with information about their labels and clases that can be used in training of ypur model are present here.

{% file src=".gitbook/assets/AIM_2024/traffic_sign_dataset_for_pytorch.zip" %}
Labbled data set for Pytorch
{% endfile %}

{% file src=".gitbook/assets/AIM_2024/Traffic_sign_dataset_yolov5-obb.zip" %}
Labbled data set for OBB (Tensorflow)
{% endfile %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Teams need to devide the images into train,val and test categories themselves and then create suiatble folders and edit this yaml file
{% endhint %}

## Labbled/bounded data set (Advance: multi class images)

The below links contain file containing images with multiple  signs classes in a single image along with information about their labels and clases that can be used in training of ypur model are present here.
