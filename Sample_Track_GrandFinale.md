## Sample Track 

### Sample Track Dimensions and Design 

The particpants are recommend to refer and design the tracks for their own practice for the final showdown in grand finale using NXP AIM kits, by refering to the below smaple track.

### Creating sample track scenarios

Participants will be required to identify the traffic signs and obstacles and take correct decissions in the Grand Finale. 

The following traffic signs will be used in the grand finale:
1. Go straight traffic sign
2. Turn Left traffic sign
3. Turn Right traffic sign
4. Stop traffic sign
5. Red light (in traffic light)
6. Green light (in traffic light)

{% hint style="info" %}
Paticipants are recommended to use the dataset that will be provided by technical team (on 31st August,2024) to practice for sign detection algroithm.
{% endhint %}

For obstacle avoidance, teams can use any real world obstacles such which are detectable by lidar on top of NXP AIM buggy. Recommned shape and designs are:
1. Cube/Cuboidal boxes
2. Poles/Stands
3. Cylindrical obstacles (Cans/cups/etc.)
4. Pyramid shape obstacles
5. Spherical obstacles (FootBall etc)
